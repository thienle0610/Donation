                    <p>Currently, many of us are lucky to have a wonderful life with adequate food and drinks. However, somewhere on this planet, people are craving the necessities of life. Especially in Africa, instead of having a safe home with basic needs, 237 million sub-Saharan Africans are chronically malnourished because of economic woes, drought, and extreme weather, which is more than in any other regions ( from World Vision Organization). In the whole of Africa, 257 million people are experiencing hunger, which is 20% of the population. With the presence of COVID-19, famishment has become a global crisis. Almost half of the South African households do not have enough money to buy food due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Xinhua 2020). According to Save The Children charitable organization, an alarming 6.7 million more children could suffer from malnutrition this year due to the coronavirus. Therefore, we must take immediate action to end their hunger now.</p>

                        <p>Hunger has become a significant issue and has alarmingly increased in rates or even in its span globally. The effects of this phenomenon are as diverse as they are devastating. Malnourishment affects communities at all levels, from infants to adults. As a result, this negatively impacts the health, education, economic and social development of entire communities across the globe. (World Vision).</p>
                        <p>Therefore, these people need your help!</p>
                        <p>Whatever the help maybe, no matter how much you can give, with small helping hands, we can group into a loving community ready to spread our love and care to people who are in need. Therefore, every donation matters.</p>
